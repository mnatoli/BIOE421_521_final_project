Draft Title: Ultrasonic Determination of Passing Distance Between Vehicles and Bicycles

Brainstorm:
Rough Description:
Team 6 – Mary Natoli and Charles Sebesta

Rough Description: 
	•	The goal of this project is to incorporate a sensing system onto an
		 Arduino/Raspberry Pi platform that will measure the distance between a bicycle and a passing vehicle. 
	•	We plan to operate the system portably using a battery pack (a portable
		 charger with USB input), so that it can be mounted on a bicycle. 
	•	For the sensing mechanism, we will use two ultrasonic range finders.
		 One will be mounted to the rear to indicate to the system when a vehicle is approaching.
		 This will trigger the collection of data from the lateral ultrasonic reader which will
		 be mounted on the side of the bicycle to measure lateral distance between the bicycle and passing objects. 
	•	The Raspberry Pi camera will also be used to acquire video from the rear of the
		 bicycle to verify and collect data on the type of vehicle passing.
	•	The data obtained from this system could be used to study factors that may cause drivers
		 to pass closer or give more room to cyclists (i.e. road size, time of day, road type,
		 helmet wearing), or to consider a safe passing law in Texas. Texas is currently one of
		 17 states that has no safe passing law.
